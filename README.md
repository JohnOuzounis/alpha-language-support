# alpha-language-support README
    Alpha Language Support was created to help write scripts using the alpha language.
    Alpha scripts must have the .al extention

## Features
    Alpha Language Support currently supports:
        -syntax highlighting
        -syntax analysis

    The syntax analyser is activated upon file save,
    the file is parsed and a pop-up message is displayed
    in case of syntax error. The messages are not very accurate
    but they provide a line number to help with debugging.

    for the best experience when writing alpha scripts
